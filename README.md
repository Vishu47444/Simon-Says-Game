The Simon Says Game is a simple, interactive memory game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors shown by the computer. The sequence gets progressively longer, testing the player's memory and focus.

This game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the interactive functionality.

Features
Color Sequence: The game generates a random sequence of colors that the player needs to follow.

Progressive Difficulty: The length of the sequence increases with each successful round.

Game Over State: The game ends if the player clicks on the wrong color in the sequence.

File Structure
The project has a simple file structure as follows:

simon-says-game/
├── index.html            # The main HTML file where the game is structured
├── style.css             # CSS file for styling the game interface
├── app.js             # JavaScript file that handles game logic

index.html: Contains the structure and layout for the game, including the buttons for each color.

style.css: Styles the game's interface, including colors, button layouts, and animations.

script.js: Handles the game logic, including generating sequences, handling user input, and managing game states.


Game Rules
The game will start with a single color in the sequence.

The sequence will be displayed, and the player must click the colors in the correct order.

After the correct sequence is completed, the game will add one more color to the sequence, making it progressively harder.

If the player clicks on the wrong color, the game ends and shows the "Game Over" message.

The player can restart the game after a game over.



Customization
You can customize the following aspects of the game:

Colors: Modify the colors in the style.css file to change the game's theme.

Game Speed: Adjust the timing between the sequence generation and user interaction in the app.js file.

UI Layout: Change the layout, button sizes, and positioning in the style.css file.
